# Hosts File Editor (Chopped)

Easily edit and manage the hosts file for your Windows PC.

## Fork Modifications
This is a personal mod. Custom copy/paste handling was conflicting with [Ditto](http://ditto-cp.sourceforge.net/) clipboard manager, so I removed it. I also did not need the single-instance functionality and off it went too.

So, not *really* a mod. Nothing of value added and lots of lovingly crafted code removed. No chopped binaries provided (yet). Everything below is from the original readme.

## Binaries

Release binaries can be downloaded from [CodePlex](http://hostsfileeditor.codeplex.com/).

## Build

Requires Visual Studio 2015 or newer.  To build the installer you must have WiX Toolset 3.7+.

Run `build-release.bat` or `build-debug.bat`. 

The binaries and setup file will be copied to the `bin` directory
